## Shadowdark roll20 sheet

This was the original home for the sheet while I worked out the kinks.

I submitted a pull request to add the sheet to the roll20 repo for community sheets, and I hope to get this sheet into roll20 soon!

So the one here might be outdated and I may remove it in the future. You can find it here instead:
